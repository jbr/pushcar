Pushcar
========

This is a derivative work.  All of the hard stuff was done by macournoyer for pusher ( http://github.com/macournoyer/pusher ).

I've been hacking it up to make it entirely within Rails, instead of as middleware, and making the interface more Rails-ey.
The advantage of this is that you can mix comet endpoints into your app and place them behind authentication, etc.


Right now, the message queue is in-memory and blocking.  Stupid and unscalable, but it works for now.  The strategy was "get something working, settle the API, then improve internals."  Hang in there.
